Grimme’s dispersion-corrected density functional theory (DFT-D) methods
have emerged among the most practical approaches to perform accurate quantum
mechanical calculations on molecular systems ranging from small clusters to
microscopic and mesoscopic samples, i.e., including hundreds or thousands of
molecules. Moreover, DFT-D functionals can be easily integrated into popular ab
initio molecular dynamics (MD) software packages to carry out first-principles
condensed-phase simulations at an affordable computational cost. In this talk, I will
present a simple computational protocol to improve the accurate description of the
intermolecular interactions of molecular clusters of growing size, considering
acetonitrile and water as test cases. Optimization of the interaction energy is
performed with reference to diffusion quantum Monte Carlo calculations, successfully
reaching the same inherent accuracy of the latter (statistical error of ∼0.1 kcal/mol per
molecule). The refined DFT-D model is then used to perform ab initio MD
simulations of liquid acetonitrile, again showing significant improvements toward
available experimental data with respect to the standard correction.
